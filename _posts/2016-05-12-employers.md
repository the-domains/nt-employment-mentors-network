> How is mentoring used in an enterprise?

**Job orientation**

Mentoring can be a most effective way of providing follow-through support to employees who have recently joined an organisation and completed their induction. The first few months in a job can often be the most challenging for a new staff member; it is also a time when new employees are most at risk from a Workplace Health & Safety perspective.

In addition to the normal staff induction processes this might be done by:

Introducing the mentee to other staff members

Being available to answer questions

Offering insight into "how things work around here"

Identifying development experiences and activities

**On the job support**

An informal chat that gives the mentee an opportunity to talk about how they are going, ask questions, settle in etc. This is an important aspect of making a new employee feel welcome and supported.

To provide advice when asked

To assist with the further development of technical skills

To support the development of professional networks and contacts

To assist in identifying gaps in experience and skills

**Staff Development & Retention**

In many larger organisations mentoring is used as a way of developing up and coming leaders. Many graduate programs utilise mentoring as a way of pairing more experienced staff with new recruits. Mentoring in these situations is usually part of a formalised program, done with the intention of developing staff into more senior roles and ensuring a process for management succession.

To identify any issues or problems that may affect the mentees performance

To show that the mentee is valued by the organisation

To map out potential career development pathways

To develop potential managers for the future

**Diversity**

Diversity in the workplace is about managing employees of different race, ethnicity, gender and age and creating a workplace where everyone is treated with respect and inclusion and are given support and the same opportunities to succeed.

Mentoring in this context can be used to:

Support the development of women into management and non-traditional roles

To develop respect and a better understanding between staff from different cultures

**Incentives to assist**
