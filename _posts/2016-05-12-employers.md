> How is mentoring used in an enterprise?

**Job orientation**

Mentoring can be a most effective way of providing follow-through support to employees who have recently joined an organisation and completed their induction. The first few months in a job can often be the most challenging for a new staff member; it is also a time when new employees are most at risk from a Workplace Health & Safety perspective.

In addition to the normal staff induction processes this might be done by:

* Introducing the mentee to other staff members
* Being available to answer questions
* Offering insight into "how things work around here"
* Identifying development experiences and activities

**On the job support**

* An informal chat that gives the mentee an opportunity to talk about how they are going, ask questions, settle in etc. This is an important aspect of making a new employee feel welcome and supported.
* To provide advice when asked
* To assist with the further development of technical skills
* To support the development of professional networks and contacts
* To assist in identifying gaps in experience and skills

**Staff Development & Retention**

In many larger organisations mentoring is used as a way of developing up and coming leaders. Many graduate programs utilise mentoring as a way of pairing more experienced staff with new recruits. Mentoring in these situations is usually part of a formalised program, done with the intention of developing staff into more senior roles and ensuring a process for management succession.

* To identify any issues or problems that may affect the mentees performance
* To show that the mentee is valued by the organisation
* To map out potential career development pathways
* To develop potential managers for the future

**Diversity**

Diversity in the workplace is about managing employees of different race, ethnicity, gender and age and creating a workplace where everyone is treated with respect and inclusion and are given support and the same opportunities to succeed.

Mentoring in this context can be used to:

* Support the development of women into management and non-traditional roles
* To develop respect and a better understanding between staff from different cultures
* To provide additional support to employees from a disadvantaged background.

**Incentives to assist**
