> Student Focused Mentoring Initiatives

The[Mentoring Australia's Apprentices Project][0] \[MAAP\] is aimed at matching Australian apprentices and trainees with experienced mentors to increase workplace participation, strengthen retention rates and to support and raise apprenticeship and traineeship completions. 

[AIME][1] provides a dynamic educational Program that gives Indigenous high school students the skills, opportunities, belief and confidence to finish school at the same rate as their peers. AIME has proven to dramatically improve the chances of Indigenous kids finishing school. AIME also connects students with post Year 12 opportunities, including further education and employment.

The [Clontarf Foundation ][2]exists to improve the education, discipline, life skills, self-esteem and employment prospects of young Aboriginal men and by doing so equips them to participate meaningfully in society.

[Learn Earn Legend!][3] is an Australian Government initiative, which supports young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to stay at school and get a job and be a legend for themselves, their family and community.

The [Australian Indigenous Education Foundation][4] (AIEF) Mentor Program is provided to Indigenous students on AIEF scholarships that are in Year 10 and above at AIEF Partner Schools. The AIEF Mentor Program works to create strong, meaningful, long term relationships which will potentially support students throughout key transitions in their life. The Program brings an Indigenous young person together with an individual with life and career experience who can share their knowledge and offer guidance, support and encouragement to help the young person through their final years of high school, the transition from school to work or further study and into adulthood.
