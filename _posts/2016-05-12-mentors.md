> Skills Needed For Effective Mentoring

Mentoring can be an extremely rewarding experience, but there are bound to be challenges along the way. The most important qualities you can bring to the process are your experience, patience and a willingness to share and learn new things yourself.

**Building Relationships**

Relationships that provide backbone to a good mentoring relationship are built on trust and mutual cooperation.

**Positive and Empowering Attitudes**

Wanting the mentee to succeed requires a generous and positive spirit. Success depends on this attitude being present.

**Clear Communication **

Whether we are giving technical instructions or delicate feedback, how well we communicate is pivotal to successful mentoring.

**Building Confidence**

Catch people doing things right and praise and acknowledge their actions and achievements

**Effective Feedback**

Giving and receiving feedback is a skill that can make or break the relationship.

**Confidentiality**

Agreements need to be established as to confidentiality within the relationship. Establishing these agreements from the start will help establish a relationship of trust and facilitate the mentoring process for both parties. There may be times when a mentor might feel it important to share information about the mentee with their supervisor or manager but this situation should be handled with the utmost care. It is always a good idea to discuss this with the mentee first and get their permission.

None of us are born mentors; effective mentoring is a skill that is developed over time through practice, experience and sometimes trial and error.

When starting out as a mentor it can be helpful to have other more experienced mentors to refer to and obtain some feedback on your approach, this is sometimes referred to as supervision.
